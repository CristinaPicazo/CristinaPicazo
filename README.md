Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cristina and I am willing to learn as much as possible and be a better developer. I am still discovering which way I would like to follow and where I would feel more confortable but until then, I will continue developing new thoughts and dreams. I would love to listen any advice, so please feel free to send me a message if you feel it could help. Thank you
